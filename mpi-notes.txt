You might need to set up MPI.  Check out http://lsi.ugr.es/~jmantas/pdp/ayuda/datos/instalaciones/Install_OpenMPI_en.pdf.

You might get some error messages if OpenMPI and MPICH2 are both installed.  Seems like simply
removing one fixes this.

You may need to install mpirun/mpiexec:
sudo apt-get install openmpi-bin
