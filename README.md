Python experiment framework

LINUX SETUP

1) Install Anaconda: Many of the necessary packages are in Anaconda

Follow instructions at: https://www.continuum.io/downloads

NOTE: There seems to be an issue with the installation of python on overachiever (a function seems to be missing from subprocesss)
Hence, installing Anaconda seems to be necessary

2) Install cvxpy

Follow instructions at: http://www.cvxpy.org/en/latest/install/

3) Copy (or generate) datasets

The raw data and split data is not included in the repository, so it needs to be generated or copied over
